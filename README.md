# PQSQ-regularized-regression
The method of generalized regression regularization through PQSQ technique is presented. This approach includes lasso, elastic net and ridge regression as partial case.

Current MatLab implementation includes several files:

L1 is majorant function for L_1 norm. See [description]( https://github.com/Mirkes/PQSQ-regularized-regression/README.md#Lab1)
L1_5 is majorant function for L_1 + L_2 norm.
L2 is majorant function for L_2 norm.
LLog is natural logarithm majorant function.
LSqrt is square root or L_0.5 quasi norm majorant function.

fastRegularisedRegression perform feature selection for regression which is regularized by Tikhonov regularization (ridge regression) with automated selection of the optimal value of regularization parameter Alpha. Detailed description can be found at ???

PQSQRegularRegr calculates PQSQ regularization of linear regression. Detailed description can be found at ???

PQSQRegularRegrPlot plots coefficient values or goodness of fit of PQSQ regularised regression fits. Detailed description can be found at ???
